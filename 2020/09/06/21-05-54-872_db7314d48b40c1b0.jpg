She was pronounced dead at 5:30 p.m. at Bellevue Hospital. The driver experienced minor injuries.\nRevel would not confirm whether its moped was involved, but told Gothamist it was “actively investigating” what happened.\nAs Gothamist points out, this is the first death involving a Revel electric moped since the company launched in New York City in 2018.\nRide-sharing company Revel expanded into Manhattan just this year after being confined to areas of the city’s outerboroughs, including Brooklyn and Queens. The company offered free memberships to healthcare workers during the height of the city’s COVID-19 outbreak\nThe company’s mopeds can go up to around 30 miles per hour, putting it in a vehicle classification that requires a driver’s license, but not a motorcycle license. \nAccording a Revel spokesperson, in addition to being licensed, drivers must also be at least 21 years old and follow all traffic laws. Passengers must be over the age of 18. Two helmets are provided with each vehicle and all riders must wear one. \nElectric mopeds, along with e-bikes, have been experiencing a surge in usage since the coronavirus pandemic began. In metropolitan areas like New York City, the vehicles have been especially popular as residents try to abide by social distancing rules and avoid public transportation. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1411874%252F079b7900-131b-486d-a5af-0cc0b94b58a8.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=krRaK1gESid2edCchEV40U0FH44=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117180%252F0e7f01e4-5f2a-4076-995e-eb5f55e56883.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=tGFysF9NR3NwMMiffADvll-UOQw=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117180%252F0e7f01e4-5f2a-4076-995e-eb5f55e56883.png%252F800x360.png?signature=akfbXiho9og3brhxO30LP_MKxe8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"800x360#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117180%252F0e7f01e4-5f2a-4076-995e-eb5f55e56883.png%252F1600x720.png?signature=XVFD-jPrR02obM9xC3W2vYvWAUE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"1600x720#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"TV news reporter dies after being ejected from Revel moped","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117180%252F0e7f01e4-5f2a-4076-995e-eb5f55e56883.png%252F800x360.png?signature=akfbXiho9og3brhxO30LP_MKxe8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","loading":"lazy","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117180%252F0e7f01e4-5f2a-4076-995e-eb5f55e56883.webp%252F800x360.webp?signature=tE4rXUnrt8uWMTpKs2BgxDzTU44=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 800w","naturalWidth":"800","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F117180%252F0e7f01e4-5f2a-4076-995e-eb5f55e56883.png%252F800x360.png?signature=akfbXiho9og3brhxO30LP_MKxe8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 800w","sizes":"800w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"TV news reporter dies after being ejected from Revel moped","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"E-scooter ridership has surged since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"TV news reporter dies after being ejected from Revel moped"}

Black-owned small businesses were hit particularly hard, but this isn't the first time they've experienced stacked odds when it comes to entrepreneurial endeavors.\nThe systemic racial wealth gap doesn't only describe the heavily mismatched salaries between Black employees and their white counterparts, or the huge disparity in family wealth that comes from centuries of oppression. It also refers to the disproportionate difficulties the Black community faces when it comes receiving loans needed to cover anything from marketing consultations to production costs. A 2017 report from the US Federal Reserve found that Black-owned firms are twice as likely to be turned down for a loan compared to white-owned firms.\nSEE ALSO: How to find and support Black-owned businesses — and why it's important\nCrowdfunding is a community-based opportunity for new businesses to get the startup funds they need (as well as a genius way to spread the word about a new venture). As of Oct. 2019, nearly 17 million people have pledged monetary support toward Kickstarter projects, with the average donation being $25. (While you'll get your money back if the project doesn't reach its funding goal by the end date, Kickstarters don't always pan out even if they do achieve funding. But we think these ideas are promising.) \nChildren's author Dr. Doresa Jennings, one of the campaign leaders we've highlighted below, covered her love for the Kickstarter community in a video on her campaign's page:\n\"The number one reason why I launch here on Kickstarter is because of the Kickstarter community — the opportunity to interact with people who are absolutely dedicated to helping dreams come to fruition.\n\nI also love Kickstarter because we're able to launch these books in a way that can be marketed because of your support. They can get into indie book stores and Black-owned bookstores because of your support. That would not be able to happen any other way.\"\nHere are five of our current favorite Black-led Kickstarter campaigns going on now: \nThe STEAM Chasers — Books on Black American STEM Innovators\n\nJennings, an award-winning middle-grade fiction author, uses her teaching expertise combined with her experience working with organizations like NASA to take middle school readers on a journey through the history of Black innovations.\nThe Boundless Blackprint is the third book in the STEAM Chasers series. (STEAM stands for \"Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math\") After We Made That and The Blackness of Space, book number three focuses infrastructure: Black architects, builders, civil engineers, designers, surveyors, and other innovators. The Boundless Blackprint focuses on \"the areas in our world that were designed, created, settled, or inhabited by Black Americans that helped to give those spaces unique vibes, feels, and soul that has been felt for over 100 years.\"\nThis campaign has already more than met its monetary goal, but is still open for more pledges until July 31. According to the campaign, backers can pledge $10 to get the ebook, $20 to get an e-book of the entire series, $25 to get a softcover copy, or $50 to get softcover copies of all three books.\nHellaBlack — A best-in-class, curated, ecommerce marketplace for Black-owned enthusiasts\n\nMashable's Chloe Bryan writes in her spotlight on the newest tool for shoppers seeking out Black-owned businesses: \n\n\"HellaBlack, a new ecommerce platform launching in August, aims to provide a sleek one-stop shop to find products from Black brands, including apparel, beauty, homewares, kids' products, and more. (It's not affiliated with the podcast of the same name.) On the website, sellers will be able to use a long list of built-in tools — including blog templates, customizable virtual \"mini-stores,\" and a streamlined customer-vendor messaging system — to share their brands' stories and move their products. The ultimate goal, according to the company's Kickstarter, is to \"build Black wealth.\"\n\nThe campaign has been awarded a \"Projects we love\" stamp by Kickstarter.\n\nHellaBlack's co-founders plan to launch the site sometime in August 2020 and, if its $50,000 goal is met, funds will be used to scale and meet marketing goals. As of July 10, the campaign is 23% funded and will be open to backers until August 14.

Each time she'd attended the festival prior to that moment, Hall had reveled in watching the Coachella and country music kids come together around something they loved, welcoming each other with open arms. Hall wanted to make something for them that was unique; something that would stand out and signal the beginning of a more inclusive country music culture. \nSo, she got some neon wire and some cowboy hats, and made 13 prototypes for what would eventually become the wildly popular light-up cowboy hats that have taken the internet by storm. She and some friends wore the prototypes to Stagecoach the following year and got an enormous amount of attention; that’s when Hall knew she was onto something. “Because I'm also a minority, it was one of those things where I was like, I really wanted to embrace the reality that I was going to inevitably stand out [in the country music scene],” she says. \nA serendipitous order of events happened soon after. Hall drew up a business plan with the assistance of a family friend, and landed her first investor when her father, who made his career in couture fashion, had a client who showed interest in the idea. Hall kept her printed business plan and stock of prototypes stowed away in her car at all times, so she would always be ready to give an impromptu Shark-Tank-style pitch. \nSEE ALSO: Tech meets fashion in Shami Oshun's stunning designs\nHall didn’t always want to be a fashion designer — after watching her dad do it for so long, she decided that she didn’t want to deal with the workload that came along with it. In fact, her initial career trajectory before Neon Cowboys’ inception was radically different. After earning bachelor's degrees in both computer science and art, Hall went straight into the gaming industry, working as a QA Analyst for the massive game publisher Electronic Arts (some of her favorite games include Red Dead Redemption, Doom, The Sims, and Harvest Moon). On the side, though, Hall was funneling her artistic talent into an Instagram-based clothing line with her brother. As it turns out, Hall would end up in the fashion industry in a bigger way than she ever expected. \n\"I think what makes us unique and special is that we’re really good at providing a party experience anywhere you are.\"\nAfter that first investment and five years of refinement, Hall’s Neon Cowboys hats started to gain traction — people were buying them and wearing them to music festivals both in the U.S. and internationally, as well as using them for cosplay and just plain fun. Inspired by the plastic toys of the ‘90s (during her design process, Hall specifically pointed to the classic transparent GameBoy and light-up sneakers so many '90s kids wore), the Neon Cowboys hats were made to exude the energy of a late night out with friends, making memories, and looking for the nearest lit-up “Bar” sign. Since then, the brand has expanded even further, offering neon-infused bralettes, trench coats, and eventually cowboy boots, elevating Neon Cowboys to more than just a one-product company. \n\nThen something even bigger happened in the form of a surprise DM Hall received from country-pop icon Kacey Musgraves. Musgraves wanted to collaborate with Hall to create her very own Neon Cowboys-style light-up hat, and that’s exactly what they did. “We would ship to every tour location that she was at, and there would be a huge line for the hats. It was crazy,” Hall says. \nIt was a long journey to get here — the country and western apparel worlds are predominantly white spaces, and Hall knew from the get-go that she would stand out and possibly be met with some pushback. “We want to help build an identity around what American culture, or Americana culture, could and should be in the future,” Hall says. To her, the intersection of fashion and tech is all about pushing boundaries to create more inclusivity in areas that haven’t historically been that way. She says she's happy to see that this inclusivity is actually starting to manifest in the country scene in a big way — artists like Kacey Musgraves, Lil Nas X, Megan Thee Stallion, and others have helped to usher in a new generation of “yeehaw culture” that welcomes people exactly how they are, especially in the LGBTQ+ and Black communities. \n“It's all about, you know, being a pioneer and trailblazing,” Hall said of her affinity for cowboy culture. For her, part of what Neon Cowboys is all about is bringing light to the history of Black cowboys and cowgirls that has been erased across the media landscape for so long. \nBut a lot of this forward momentum was challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic. Music festivals, which are Neon Cowboys' bread and butter, have been canceled all across the world. “That really forced us to think about what makes this brand special. Is it just because people are going to festivals, or is it something bigger? I think what makes us unique and special is that we’re really good at providing a party experience anywhere you are,” Hall said. She mentioned she’s even seen her customers wearing their hats out in regular, daily life — like on trips to the grocery store.\nOnce Hall realized that we’d all be quarantined for the foreseeable future, she decided to pivot to products that people could enjoy at home, including decorative neon signs, cowboy hats for pets, and — you guessed it — face masks. Light-up face masks, to be exact (as well as non-glow masks; both are totally washable and reusable as to not create unnecessary waste). “We wanted to kind of encourage people to have a little bit more joy even if they can't leave the house,” Hall says about the new products. The masks have been a huge success, and Hall hopes that will help keep the business afloat until festival season makes its return, whenever that may be. \n\nThe conversation surrounding the Black Lives Matter movement has also thrust more attention onto Hall and her brand. “I didn't really realize how much of a voice we had in this space until people started to show more of an interest in seeking out African American businesses,” she said. Even with Neon Cowboys taking a hit from the pandemic, Hall is still dedicated to being a brand that gives back to the community. Recently, they sold a plain black version of their face masks, and donated all of the proceeds to digitalundivided and Grassroots Law Project — the donations totaled just shy of $6,000.\nAs for the future of fashion-tech, Hall’s hopes for the medium are that it becomes more accessible to a larger audience, both in terms of pricing and availability. “Fashion-tech, in general, is a lot of one-offs, which is fine, but that's not how it's going to become a normalized thing. People have to have it in their hands,” she says. Hall adds that while trying to think ten steps ahead (using Google Glass as an example) is great, she also thinks it’s necessary to design fashion-tech that’s just a fun conduit for self-expression that everyone can take part in.\nWhen asked about what keeps her motivated to continue pushing boundaries in the fashion and tech spaces, Hall told Mashable that the reactions that she gets to her products from fans are more than enough to spark the desire to press on, whether it’s a tag on Instagram or a video of a customer dancing around their room with their Neon Cowboys hat on. “It’s just fun to be able to create something that so many people resonate with, that gives them inspiration or just an amazing night out,” Hall says. \n“For me, it’s similar to Disney World, where they have the Mickey Mouse ear hats that everyone wears in the parks; something that just makes you lose your inhibitions and have a better time,\" Hall added. \"You’re not taking yourself too seriously, and you’re not taking the world too seriously. You can be a kid again and just play.”"},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1387268%252Fa2350979-9f45-4d9d-ad3d-e7b576f4277b.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=PQgNaQaaLuFeGHpJy5RcYajL328=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116687%252F03fe1938-5e10-466b-8454-4f6fe32dd2c1.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=Q2QxWYbPXbjFjHBZPLP6RoaV9-w=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116687%252F03fe1938-5e10-466b-8454-4f6fe32dd2c1.png%252F280x158.png?signature=91KTQXEkRnI-pENewCxXq9z_cI8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116687%252F03fe1938-5e10-466b-8454-4f6fe32dd2c1.png%252F560x316.png?signature=s4bRQ2OOYLEU0vMGwYkXh5lcTbc=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"Neon Cowboys: The Black-owned fashion brand lighting up country music","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116687%252F03fe1938-5e10-466b-8454-4f6fe32dd2c1.png%252F280x158.png?signature=91KTQXEkRnI-pENewCxXq9z_cI8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","loading":"lazy","version_webp_srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116687%252F03fe1938-5e10-466b-8454-4f6fe32dd2c1.webp%252F280x158.webp?signature=MyuTZ0VaExpsjxZxx_LHOVsnKiA=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","naturalWidth":"280","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F116687%252F03fe1938-5e10-466b-8454-4f6fe32dd2c1.png%252F280x158.png?signature=91KTQXEkRnI-pENewCxXq9z_cI8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","sizes":"280w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Neon Cowboys: The Black-owned fashion brand lighting up country music","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Designer Asia Hall is pushing the boundaries of western apparel.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Culture","channel_label":"Culture","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Culture/","order_number":"","tweet_text":"Neon Cowboys: The Black-owned fashion brand lighting up country music"},{"_id":"5ea1693e2463a3036c000001","id":"/video/augment-bionics-3d-print-face-shields/","title":"Before coronavirus, they 3D printed affordable prosthetics.

We connected through QuarantineChat, which facilitates calls for people who are currently self-isolating. \nNow that the coronavirus has reached pandemic level, many countries have instituted lockdowns; those in the United States are heavily encouraged to stay indoors and flatten the curve. With self-isolation causing people to be apart from their loved ones, coupled with the anxiety of the whole situation, it's easy for loneliness to seep into everyday life. \nSome are getting creative to combat loneliness, however. Enter QuarantineChat, which was created by artists Danielle Baskin and Max Hawkins. QuarantineChat is a feature in their app Dialup, which calls people at set (or random, in the case of QuarantineChat) times to chat one-on-one. \n\nI've had several \"quarantine chats\" so far, including the one with the stranger from Los Angeles. Here's how it works: I downloaded the Dialup app and opted in for QuarantineChat. Every day, they call me and facilitate pairing me with someone else. With every call comes the same prompt: to look outside our window and describe what's there. I told her I was in Brooklyn, and outside was not the norm of cars driving by and folks chatting outside their homes, but instead occasional single walkers. \nSEE ALSO: The movies we're watching on repeat while social distancing\nShe asked about stoops because stoop culture, the act of shooting the shit on one's stoop, doesn't really exist in LA. I told her that yes, there are stoops and usually people sitting on them, but not in the past week. The call reminded me of conversations I have when I'm on vacation, chatting with folks about our hometowns.\nDialup itself launched in 2019 as a way for Baskin and Hawkins to have check-ins with their self-employed friends. Now, the app connects friends as well as communities, companies, and conferences through random calls. Beyond QuarantineChat, Dialup has many themed options for calls — everything from talking about your breakfast, memories, and the full moon. There are even calls where people can read poems or tarot cards to each other. \n\nAs self-quarantine and isolation took hold, Baskin and Hawkins thought their app would be of use to people. \"In the last week of February, we heard so many stories about people in quarantine and self-isolation,\" they wrote in an emailed statement to Mashable. \"We thought our app would be great to combat feelings of disconnection.\" \nDue to isolation, people aren't having the same daily small talk, say with their barista. \"We hope our project brings magic and serendipity to a new reality where hundreds of thousands of people might be stuck inside for the next month,\" Baskin and Hawkins said. \nMy quarantine chats have all been pleasant and with pleasant people. Considering that this is a stressful time for us all — and that we're all on the internet to begin with — it was a welcome reprieve and a nice surprise that it has not devolved into ChatRoulette territory. \nRather, my calls have been with people interested in my life and how I'm taking this whole situation, and in turn I hear their stories. Their careers ranged from helping the homeless to marketing to design. I even followed one on Twitter. These connections serve as a nice reminder that even though I'm physically alone, everyone — including strangers across the continent — are going through the same thing. \n\nBaskin and Hawkins told me they've received heartwarming anecdotes from people using QuarantineChat and Dialup from all over the world. People from places such as Madrid, Berlin, and Tennessee are sharing experiences with each other. \"It's been beautiful to get these glimpses into lives from the first-person perspective,\" they said.\nSEE ALSO: Don't despair about being single while social distancing. Here's why.\nHow long social distancing will last is still up in the air, but people are already making efforts to connect — be it over FaceTime, on dating apps, or services like QuarantineChat. There may be days I don't pick up the phone (you can simply not pick up or even opt out if it's not for you), but having the option of meeting someone new in a time where I can't meet anyone is a luxury. \n\"While some people have told us it's great for their mental health, we sometimes get messages about niche commonalities they had with their match,\" Baskin and Hawkins said. \"People often describe it with the word 'magical.'\"\nAfter I told the Los Angeles stranger the view outside my window, she described hers: beautiful, with palm trees dotting the street. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112370%252F50c476c3-a812-469f-be90-86a5f64eb95c.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=6ohewy3PL780pEuroNHu0fwEba8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112370%252F50c476c3-a812-469f-be90-86a5f64eb95c.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=U11Gy8aNOd4pZ58G79bbHlmYg_A=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112370%252F50c476c3-a812-469f-be90-86a5f64eb95c.png%252F280x158.png?signature=NKHKVAdaUtWUs_QftGsmerbmtB8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112370%252F50c476c3-a812-469f-be90-86a5f64eb95c.png%252F560x316.png?signature=xV9hNRx2SNur5y1MDdaHbZ1WUww=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"QuarantineChat is here to help us survive social distancing","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112370%252F50c476c3-a812-469f-be90-86a5f64eb95c.png%252F280x158.png?signature=NKHKVAdaUtWUs_QftGsmerbmtB8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","loading":"lazy","naturalWidth":"280","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112370%252F50c476c3-a812-469f-be90-86a5f64eb95c.png%252F280x158.png?signature=NKHKVAdaUtWUs_QftGsmerbmtB8=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w","sizes":"280w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"QuarantineChat is here to help us survive social distancing","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"You can chat with someone anywhere in the world.

They're community spaces, where customers go to browse, talk, and eat. It's how they've survived Amazon's discounted prices and fast shipping. But now, with the coronavirus forcing people to stay in their homes, it could cause them to go out of business. \nIndependent bookstore Third Place Books has three locations in a 10-mile radius of Amazon’s headquarters in Seattle. Managing partner Robert Sindelar said he didn’t know if he’d have to close the stores temporarily after the governor's recent order to shut down restaurants, bars, and recreational spaces. \n“If I can within the government guidelines keep the doors open, even at a low sales rate, I can keep my staff whole, and they don’t have to worry about their financial wellbeing,\" said Sindelar, who oversees 45 employees. “If I can keep the doors open, that’s the difference between laying people off and not laying people off.\" \n\nSindelar started working at Third Place Books just before the internet was adopted in mass in 1998. At the time, the bookstore sold to suburbanites looking to spend time in its 15,000-square-foot space. Amazon, on the other hand, was busy surviving the dot-com bubble burst.\nToday, Amazon owns 42 percent of the market for physical books and 89 percent for ebooks. \n“The need and necessity changed. Most of the things you want to do in life you can do with your screen now. So when you choose to step away from your screen, what do you want out of that experience?” Sindelar said. “You want a meaningful experience in physical space.”\n\nNow, Third Place Books depends on food and coffee to draw in customers. At the White Whale Bookstore in Pittsburgh, literary events make up 40 percent of co-owner Jill Yeomans’ business. \nBut unlike the financial crisis in 2008, the coronavirus threatens these social spaces. In response, independent bookstores from the East to West Coast are temporarily closing their doors to contain the outbreak. Powell's Books in Portland, the world's largest independent bookstore, was forced to lay off most of its staff.\nMany are scrambling for creative solutions to sustain themselves. Third Place Books, for example, is offering free shipping for online purchases and Grubhub deliveries for bookstore cafe orders. It's also considering moving upcoming book fairs and author events online. Other bookstores are offering curbside pickup for local orders. \n15 NYC bookstores offering curbside pickup and delivery https://t.co/MiAvaQCGid@greenlightbklyn @cafeconlibrosbk @CommunityBkstr @wordbookstores @booksaremagicbk @Center4Fiction@_archestratus_ @thelitbar @bookculture @bookclubbar @mcnallyjackson @astoriabookshop @WordUpBooks pic.twitter.com/nhdHtopw6A— 6sqft (@6sqft) March 19, 2020\n\nResource-strapped bookstores like the White Whale will depend on phone and email sales. There are some startups, however, trying to offer relief. \nAndy Hunter, publisher of Literary Hub and four other literature sites, told me only about 150 booksellers in the country sell a meaningful amount of books online. The cost of building a website, combined with the lack of inventory and human resources to compete with Amazon, leave about 85 percent of bookstores out of e-commerce, he said.\n\nHunter founded the five-person startup Bookshop, which he presented before the American Booksellers Association at a conference ahead of its launch in February.\nYeomans recalled initial skepticism from her fellow indie booksellers at the conference. Having witnessed the way Amazon had spread its tentacles, many speculated that Bookshop also wanted a big cut of their sales.\n\"There were hundreds of booksellers waiting to hear what he had to say, and I walked out of it like, 'This person cares about indie booksellers, they want to support us,'\" Yeomans said. \"They’ve looked at research, the website looks smart and intuitive and young. And it really felt like something that can add to our sales — not instead of them.\"\n\nHere’s how it works: Hunter’s team creates Bookshop stores for local booksellers for free (think: Etsy stores). His book distribution partner Ingram then takes care of inventory, packing, and shipping. Finally, indies receive 30 percent of the cover price from sales they generate via link referral, and 10 percent from those by non-bookstore affiliates. (In comparison, Amazon offers only a 4.5-percent commission to whomever’s links generate sales for its site.) Altogether, Bookshop contributes 75 percent of its total profit margins to local bookstores.\nTo be sure, Bookshop still takes some money. But it gives shops like the White Whale, and around 800 others, a chance to take their business online. \nIn Sindelar’s words, it's a “sophisticated vehicle” that allows indie buyers to support the local bookstore market as a collective whole.\nSeattle-based startup Libro.fm is giving all proceeds from first-time purchases to independent bookstores  in light of the coronavirus outbreak. \nTo support independent bookstores, we have a deal for new members—when you start a membership with code SHOPBOOKSTORESNOW, you’ll get two audiobooks for the price of one and 100% of your payment will go to your bookstore. 📚Help out at https://t.co/5R21TFv0z0 #ShopBookstoresNow pic.twitter.com/T9pNM8CsPO— Libro.fm (@librofm) March 15, 2020\n\nBut where it stands out, Sindelar thinks, is its ability to help independent bookstores penetrate publishing’s fastest growing market: audiobooks. Amazon and its subsidiary Audible control more than half of U.S. audiobook sales. \nBefore Libro.fm, local bookstores were largely confined to selling CD audiobooks. But as consumers transitioned from CD and MP3 players to smartphones, they were left out of the digital audiobook marketplace where Audible and Apple now dominate. \n“I had no ability to sell my customers digital audio. I was completely out of the game, so I wasn’t really sacrificing anything,” Sindelar said of Libro.fm.\n“All my effort is really on the front end of getting you into that ecosystem. If you become a subscriber, then I’m throwing no labor into selling to you at that point.”\nBut Bookshop and Libro.fm, along with other book startups, depend on limited budgets and grassroots marketing.\nIronically, that, too, was Jeff Bezo’s strategy for Amazon in 1997. He didn't advertise Amazon anywhere in its inaugural year, and relied instead on the media and word of mouth for exposure. \nLocal bookstores know where that story led. This time around, maybe tech companies and independent booksellers can build something different. "},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1250934%252F8718fc26-2c9f-4870-8e0a-6299d1626024.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=2au_iXrq-38zmHP7yiCnScpNtfE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112007%252Fd54fd052-a47b-41a7-bc0e-484ba43b0666.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=7g9fyhyshXn7gTj31xDU44wrBkI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112007%252Fd54fd052-a47b-41a7-bc0e-484ba43b0666.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=_K6CNaDWhpxB-hz0t_QMxT2N5P4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112007%252Fd54fd052-a47b-41a7-bc0e-484ba43b0666.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=FBEP2MFflUg89GUzPsvHo0UV5b8=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112007%252Fd54fd052-a47b-41a7-bc0e-484ba43b0666.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=vMyv_2WOVVuz6j6FVriPE0i5E8Q=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F112007%252Fd54fd052-a47b-41a7-bc0e-484ba43b0666.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=5scCp0QNtu9ZjwHbsH48jKvWnjA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"The family-owned White Whale Bookstore in Pittsburgh has decided to close its doors in light of the coronavirus pandemic.

Though the company says a consumer-ready product is still years away, it's showing off its AR tech for the first time as part of its vision to one day replace the smartphone.\nBehind it all is what the startup calls \"invisible computing,\" the idea that information will appear seamlessly around us as we want it, rather than via smartphone screens. \n\"It's a display, so you can put whatever information you want to see on it,\" says the company's vice president of product and marketing, Steve Sinclair. \"It could be as simple as notifications, like you get on your Apple Watch. But it can be as complex as as anything that fits into the real world and gives context to the real world, which I think is what people expect when they talk about AR.\"\nI recently had the opportunity to try out some early versions of Mojo Vision's lenses, and I was surprised at how far along the technology is. In one demo, I held a prototype lens up to my eye and watched a video of a cyclist while heart rate and other details were overlaid onto the video. As AR content goes, it was fairly rudimentary, but the fact that this was all happening via a contact lens that was only a bit thicker than the ones I wear every day was impressive. \nMojo Vision isn't the only company betting on an AR-powered future, though it appears to be farther along than its competitors. Samsung has patented smart contact lens concepts. Apple is reportedly working on an augmented reality headset, as well as AR glasses that could one day replace the iPhone. Facebook is also working on AR glasses, but has indicated the project is still in the early research stage. \nAnd even though Mojo Vision has some of the tech down, there are still many unanswered questions about how these types or augmented reality interfaces will work — not to mention whether or not there will be an appetite for tiny AR displays in our eyeballs. \nThat's partially why the company says it will first target medical use cases for the lenses. While Sinclair says Mojo Vision's contact lenses are likely still \"a couple\" years away for any kind of consumer version, the company is, working with the FDA on specialized lenses that can help people with low vision or conditions that affect eyesight, like macular degeneration. \nBut Sinclair says the company's ultimate goal isn't to be a medical device company. \n\"We aspire to be a consumer company that sells this to everyone. We hope to someday replace smartphones.\""},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1153424%252Fdb1d5941-a163-49a8-865d-f5d6f0ad48ca.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=-zICKOfnb5-TKRYhoXMHvwC_77o=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109352%252F6fbeea03-14f1-464b-961e-2f1ee1a43d9e.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=Busf7pAIGk_HQ3qYcVGgNDE4-4o=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109352%252F6fbeea03-14f1-464b-961e-2f1ee1a43d9e.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=wCZ_JrDJKO7ip9JF9lvvLLMSAeM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109352%252F6fbeea03-14f1-464b-961e-2f1ee1a43d9e.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=Er1zXm_jfkmS2hOPI4T5jPwHjFU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109352%252F6fbeea03-14f1-464b-961e-2f1ee1a43d9e.jpg%252F280x157.jpg?signature=778EHspLcxMbl66iGEOy8ngk1a4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109352%252F6fbeea03-14f1-464b-961e-2f1ee1a43d9e.jpg%252F560x314.jpg?signature=u8AA-6Fyes8uYRmicrgtVKEm9Qs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"microcontent","alt":"Mojo Vision wants to replace smartphone will smart contact lenses, but is it possible?","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-augmented-reality-contact-lenses-mojo-vision.jpg","data":{"fragment":"lead-image","url":null,"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/lead-img-augmented-reality-contact-lenses-mojo-vision.jpg","micro":1},"src_type":"jpg","loading":"lazy","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1153424%252Fdb1d5941-a163-49a8-865d-f5d6f0ad48ca.jpg%252F280x157__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=-pYbTeaIyHpKqANRg1a1ZRRvhYk=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1153424%252Fdb1d5941-a163-49a8-865d-f5d6f0ad48ca.jpg%252F356x205__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=FjDEtRFDDeqmXBsuBrz1UlfjTFE=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-caption","content":"Mojo Vision wants to replace smartphone will smart contact lenses, but is it possible?"}},"image_credit_info":{"tag_attributes":{"class":"image-credit","content":"Image:  mojo Vision"}},"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":{}},"display_title":"Augmented reality contacts are real, and could be here sooner than you think","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Watch out Apple, one startup wants to skip AR glasses and go straight to contacts.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Tech/","tweet_text":"Augmented reality contacts are real, and could be here sooner than you think"}],"page":1,"per_page":10,"total":8998}

She was pronounced dead at 5:30 p.m. at Bellevue Hospital. The driver experienced minor injuries.\nRevel would not confirm whether its moped was involved, but told Gothamist it was “actively investigating” what happened.\nAs Gothamist points out, this is the first death involving a Revel electric moped since the company launched in New York City in 2018.\nRide-sharing company Revel expanded into Manhattan just this year after being confined to areas of the city’s outerboroughs, including Brooklyn and Queens. The company offered free memberships to healthcare workers during the height of the city’s COVID-19 outbreak\nThe company’s mopeds can go up to around 30 miles per hour, putting it in a vehicle classification that requires a driver’s license, but not a motorcycle license. \nAccording a Revel spokesperson, in addition to being licensed, drivers must also be at least 21 years old and follow all traffic laws.

We connected through QuarantineChat, which facilitates calls for people who are currently self-isolating. \nNow that the coronavirus has reached pandemic level, many countries have instituted lockdowns; those in the United States are heavily encouraged to stay indoors and flatten the curve. With self-isolation causing people to be apart from their loved ones, coupled with the anxiety of the whole situation, it's easy for loneliness to seep into everyday life. \nSome are getting creative to combat loneliness, however. Enter QuarantineChat, which was created by artists Danielle Baskin and Max Hawkins. QuarantineChat is a feature in their app Dialup, which calls people at set (or random, in the case of QuarantineChat) times to chat one-on-one. \n\nI've had several \"quarantine chats\" so far, including the one with the stranger from Los Angeles. Here's how it works: I downloaded the Dialup app and opted in for QuarantineChat. Every day, they call me and facilitate pairing me with someone else. With every call comes the same prompt: to look outside our window and describe what's there. I told her I was in Brooklyn, and outside was not the norm of cars driving by and folks chatting outside their homes, but instead occasional single walkers. \nSEE ALSO: The movies we're watching on repeat while social distancing\nShe asked about stoops because stoop culture, the act of shooting the shit on one's stoop, doesn't really exist in LA. I told her that yes, there are stoops and usually people sitting on them, but not in the past week. The call reminded me of conversations I have when I'm on vacation, chatting with folks about our hometowns.\nDialup itself launched in 2019 as a way for Baskin and Hawkins to have check-ins with their self-employed friends. Now, the app connects friends as well as communities, companies, and conferences through random calls. Beyond QuarantineChat, Dialup has many themed options for calls — everything from talking about your breakfast, memories, and the full moon. There are even calls where people can read poems or tarot cards to each other. \n\nAs self-quarantine and isolation took hold, Baskin and Hawkins thought their app would be of use to people. \"In the last week of February, we heard so many stories about people in quarantine and self-isolation,\" they wrote in an emailed statement to Mashable. \"We thought our app would be great to combat feelings of disconnection.\" \nDue to isolation, people aren't having the same daily small talk, say with their barista. \"We hope our project brings magic and serendipity to a new reality where hundreds of thousands of people might be stuck inside for the next month,\" Baskin and Hawkins said. \nMy quarantine chats have all been pleasant and with pleasant people. Considering that this is a stressful time for us all — and that we're all on the internet to begin with — it was a welcome reprieve and a nice surprise that it has not devolved into ChatRoulette territory. \nRather, my calls have been with people interested in my life and how I'm taking this whole situation, and in turn I hear their stories. Their careers ranged from helping the homeless to marketing to design. I even followed one on Twitter. These connections serve as a nice reminder that even though I'm physically alone, everyone — including strangers across the continent — are going through the same thing. \n\nBaskin and Hawkins told me they've received heartwarming anecdotes from people using QuarantineChat and Dialup from all over the world. People from places such as Madrid, Berlin, and Tennessee are sharing experiences with each other. \"It's been beautiful to get these glimpses into lives from the first-person perspective,\" they said.\nSEE ALSO: Don't despair about being single while social distancing. Here's why.\nHow long social distancing will last is still up in the air, but people are already making efforts to connect — be it over FaceTime, on dating apps, or services like QuarantineChat.

Though the company says a consumer-ready product is still years away, it's showing off its AR tech for the first time as part of its vision to one day replace the smartphone.\nBehind it all is what the startup calls \"invisible computing,\" the idea that information will appear seamlessly around us as we want it, rather than via smartphone screens. \n\"It's a display, so you can put whatever information you want to see on it,\" says the company's vice president of product and marketing, Steve Sinclair. \"It could be as simple as notifications, like you get on your Apple Watch. But it can be as complex as as anything that fits into the real world and gives context to the real world, which I think is what people expect when they talk about AR.\"\nI recently had the opportunity to try out some early versions of Mojo Vision's lenses, and I was surprised at how far along the technology is. In one demo, I held a prototype lens up to my eye and watched a video of a cyclist while heart rate and other details were overlaid onto the video. As AR content goes, it was fairly rudimentary, but the fact that this was all happening via a contact lens that was only a bit thicker than the ones I wear every day was impressive. \nMojo Vision isn't the only company betting on an AR-powered future, though it appears to be farther along than its competitors. Samsung has patented smart contact lens concepts. Apple is reportedly working on an augmented reality headset, as well as AR glasses that could one day replace the iPhone. Facebook is also working on AR glasses, but has indicated the project is still in the early research stage. \nAnd even though Mojo Vision has some of the tech down, there are still many unanswered questions about how these types or augmented reality interfaces will work — not to mention whether or not there will be an appetite for tiny AR displays in our eyeballs. \nThat's partially why the company says it will first target medical use cases for the lenses. While Sinclair says Mojo Vision's contact lenses are likely still \"a couple\" years away for any kind of consumer version, the company is, working with the FDA on specialized lenses that can help people with low vision or conditions that affect eyesight, like macular degeneration. \nBut Sinclair says the company's ultimate goal isn't to be a medical device company. \n\"We aspire to be a consumer company that sells this to everyone. We hope to someday replace smartphones.\""},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1153424%252Fdb1d5941-a163-49a8-865d-f5d6f0ad48ca.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.jpg?signature=-zICKOfnb5-TKRYhoXMHvwC_77o=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109352%252F6fbeea03-14f1-464b-961e-2f1ee1a43d9e.jpg%252F1438x0.jpg?signature=Busf7pAIGk_HQ3qYcVGgNDE4-4o=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109352%252F6fbeea03-14f1-464b-961e-2f1ee1a43d9e.jpg%252F356x205.jpg?signature=wCZ_JrDJKO7ip9JF9lvvLLMSAeM=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F109352%252F6fbeea03-14f1-464b-961e-2f1ee1a43d9e.jpg%252F712x410.jpg?signature=Er1zXm_jfkmS2hOPI4T5jPwHjFU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution:

Away is resigning just days after her internal Slack messages were made public.\nSteph Korey, who co-founded the suitcase company in 2015, is stepping down from her CEO role and will be replaced by Lululemon Athletica's chief operating officer, Stuart Haselden, the company announced. The former CEO will remain on Away's board and will act as executive chairman of the company.\nKorey's departure comes days after The Verge published a damning account of the now former CEO's management style. Employees quoted in the article accused Korey of creating a toxic work environment where workers were publicly shamed by executives in company Slack channels and customer service representatives were routinely overworked.\n\"Employees were asked to work exceedingly long hours and limit their paid time off,\" The Verge wrote. \"Their projects were brutally criticized by executives on public Slack channels. They were reprimanded for not answering messages immediately — even late at night and on weekends.\"\nAway did't immediately respond to a request for comment on Korey's departure. In a statement published after The Verge's initial report, Korey said that she was \"appalled and embarrassed\" to read her messages. \nMaking things right at Away pic.twitter.com/QPlRlk4pLR— Steph Korey (@stephkorey) December 6, 2019\n\n\"What you read in the article doesn't reflect the company we want to be; and we will continue to work to improve,\" she wrote.\nKorey, along with co-founder Jen Rubio, started the millennial-friendly luggage company in 2015. The company was valued at $1.4 billion earlier this year. \nNow, Away with you, Steph Korey.\nUPDATE: Dec. 10, 2019, 9:24 a.m. PST In a statement, Korey said Haselden is a \"deeply experienced leader and operator who will be transformative for Away's next phase of growth.\" \n“Over the past eight months, I led the recruiting process that led us to bringing on Stuart, and I’m so thrilled for him to join the company as Away’s CEO,\" Korey wrote. \"Stuart is a deeply experienced leader and operator who will be transformative for Away’s next phase of growth.

A WeWork spokesperson told CNBC that the layoffs were being made in order to “create a more efficient organization.”\nThe layoffs come following WeWork’s botched IPO attempt this summer. The company, which was valued at around $50 billion just earlier this year, ended up pulling the initial public offering, but not before shining a light on its big financial losses and corporate mismanagement run amok.\nWeWork CEO Adam Neumann, who bears much of the responsibility for the company's downfall, left his role in September. In order to save the company, SoftBank, an investor in WeWork, acquired 80 percent of the startup the following month. Rumors of the impending layoffs have spread ever since. \nIn its statement to CNBC, WeWork also said that it would be providing its former employees with “severance, continued benefits, and other forms of assistance to aid in their career transition.” \nAdam Neumann made more than $700,000 for each and every person getting fired from WeWork todayhttps://t.co/XL8gXPFbwD— tc (@chillmage) November 21, 2019\n\nHowever, whatever severance or assistance these employees are slated to receive will obviously be a far cry from the $1.7 billion Adam Neumann made after stepping down from the company he left in tatters."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1086282%252F833bb88e-9573-4001-b3e2-59fbe0d22c99.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=oqvHA72SSMAmb1gqM9ooxs73AP4=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106836%252Ff1f83006-de34-4c16-bd4a-79ac150f34fb.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=FcvxlzJjmVz34V5T67hk3tnnYDA=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106836%252Ff1f83006-de34-4c16-bd4a-79ac150f34fb.png%252F356x205.png?signature=XcGZ1cY6mmwFcnBrmGB_1Shwc64=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106836%252Ff1f83006-de34-4c16-bd4a-79ac150f34fb.png%252F712x410.png?signature=JbHZZDz1NKUPqrvSvAJMoLrLuNU=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106836%252Ff1f83006-de34-4c16-bd4a-79ac150f34fb.png%252F280x157.png?signature=MgALQb4dIn7BeGE8zE1QdoZTACg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106836%252Ff1f83006-de34-4c16-bd4a-79ac150f34fb.png%252F560x314.png?signature=Js4lhs6h4TRse0bhN9eveCpTP10=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"WeWork's Adam Neumann got $1.7 billion. 2,400 employees just got fired.","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106836%252Ff1f83006-de34-4c16-bd4a-79ac150f34fb.png%252F356x205.png?signature=XcGZ1cY6mmwFcnBrmGB_1Shwc64=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","loading":"lazy","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106836%252Ff1f83006-de34-4c16-bd4a-79ac150f34fb.png%252F280x157.png?signature=MgALQb4dIn7BeGE8zE1QdoZTACg=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F106836%252Ff1f83006-de34-4c16-bd4a-79ac150f34fb.png%252F356x205.png?signature=XcGZ1cY6mmwFcnBrmGB_1Shwc64=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"WeWork's Adam Neumann got $1.7 billion. 2,400 employees just got fired.","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"He failed up.

We’re almost ten years out from the United Nations’ ambitious 2030 sustainable development goals—a blueprint to help us with challenges like access to clean water and combatting climate change—and there’s still a lot of work to be done.\nIncreasingly, businesses are playing a leading role, as more and more corporations and small businesses, alike, focus on sustainability and how they can lend a hand to the planet. Executives across industries are realizing that sustainable practices aren’t just good for the environment, they also help to future-proof supply chains, fuel new product development and  build reputation, inside and outside of the organization. The shift comes as consumers increasingly prefer sustainable products made by companies investing in sustainable business practices.\nAs Krystal Nelson, Founder and CEO of sustainability consulting firm I-Impakt Consulting LLC puts it, “If a company wants to stay competitive, avert risk and retain customers, embracing sustainability can no longer be an option. Companies that choose to forgo integrating business practices that ensure sustainable sourcing, protect human rights, and reduce carbon emissions put themselves at risk with compliance agencies and consumer loyalty.” \nBusiness can lead on sustainability\nMany businesses have crafted their own sustainability goals that go hand-in-hand with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted by all 193 member states of the UN. Take one example: Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s largest brewer, has a set of sustainability goals it wants to accomplish by 2025. The brewer has set out to save water, support farmers, reduce packaging, and reduce its carbon footprint. \nTo help, it took a cue from Silicon Valley and set up an accelerator, working with startup entrepreneurs worldwide on real solutions. The startups receive six months of programming, mentorship from top scientists, academics, venture capitalists and corporate sustainability leaders, up to $100,000 to pilot their solution within the supply chain, and the opportunity for investment from AB InBev and partners.\nIt’s a project that shows how AB InBev clearly sees the new role business can play in today’s socially conscious world. “When people look at companies, they look not only at what you offer in terms of products and services, but what’s behind those products and services,” Carlos Brito, the CEO of AB-InBev, recently told Fortune. “What are the values you believe in. What you’re trying to push in terms of solutions for the community at large.”\nIn the world of corporate-led sustainability, this program offers an example of early success. \nThe 21 companies that were selected to join the company’s 100+ Accelerator in its first year are already making headway on a variety of issues, from empowering farmers with new technology to making better use of wastewater. \n“At AB InBev we have a long-term vision to build a company to last for the next 100+ years. Brewing the highest quality beer requires the highest quality natural ingredients, which is why we say that sustainability is our business,” said Tony Milikin, AB InBev’s Chief Sustainability & Procurement Officer. “Although we are a global company, our approach is rooted in the communities where we live and work. Through the 100+ Accelerator, innovators benefit from our resources, experience and global reach to speed their progress and scale.”\nCorporate leadership, startup power\nOne of these startups, microbiologist Paul Baskis’s Baswood, is using its energy efficient treatment to clean wastewater, which is then reused. The tech mimics how algae breaks down organic materials in rivers, and it’s helping companies use water more sustainably. It’s a crucial effort, since by 2050, water could become a scarce resource for 5.7 billion people worldwide, according to the U.N., amid rapid population growth and unsustainable water practices. As part of the accelerator, Baswood piloted their technology at the Karbach brewery. By the end of the program, Baswood had successfully treated 75,000 gallons of wastewater for reuse in brewery operations. \nAustin-based Accelerator startup BanQu is improving the finances of farmers in developing countries with its blockchain-based software. BanQu founder Ashish Gadnis saw the need for the technology while volunteering in the Democratic Republic of Congo with the U.S. Agency for International Development. He met a mother who couldn’t get a loan to pay for her child’s tuition because banks didn’t consider her paper receipts for her years of barley growing as valid proofs of sale. Now, BanQu’s tech gives farmers transparency into transactions and digital payments on their mobile devices. During the pilot, a few thousand farmers in Zambia and Uganda sold their harvests through BanQu to AB InBev’s local breweries. The tech is helping AB InBev in its goal to get 100% of direct farmers skilled, connected, and financially empowered.\nCompanies worldwide are also zeroing in on sustainable packaging, a goal also part of the SDGs. For AB InBev, success means getting 100% of its products in packaging that’s returnable or made almost entirely from recycled materials. Brazil’s Rodrigo Oliveira and his Green Mining startup are helping the brewer move toward that goal. \nOliveira, along with Adriano Leite and Leandro Metropolo, created software that uses sales data to find spots where a large amount of post-consumer waste – like beer bottles – is being generated, at bars and restaurants, for example. Green Mining installs a collection hub nearby. Collectors pick up the waste and bring it to the hub where it’s sorted for reuse by the manufacturer or recycling. Either way, the waste is kept out of the landfill. That’s crucial in Brazil, where Oliveira says some 75% of Brazilians don’t sort recyclables and most municipalities don't have recycling collection. During their pilot, Green Mining collected over 200 tons of glass across Sao Paolo, Rio de Janiero and Brazilia. \nAt startup Earthly Labs, CEO and founder Amy George has set out to solve the climate challenge by converting and avoiding CO2 emissions. The startup’s hardware and software helps breweries capture and reuse CO2, reducing both costs and emissions. Carbon capture is a key technology in  achieving, AB InBev’s 2025 goal of a 25% reduction in CO2 emissions. Over and above that, by 2030 Earthly Labs has a goal of capturing 1 billion metric tons of CO2 emissions or the equivalent of 26 billion trees.\n\"To address a challenge like climate change by 2030, we need a combination of entrepreneurs innovating at breakneck speeds and industry leaders ready to experiment and deploy,” said George. “AB InBev's 100+ Accelerator has provided the perfect canvas for accelerating impact for Earthly Labs’ goal to avoid 1 billion tons of CO2 emissions\"\n2019 and onward\nNext week, the world’s political and business leaders will join together in New York City to discuss economic development, among a huge range of social and environmental issues. Together, they'll be seeking collective solutions toward achieving the ambitious SDGs. Cooperation, urgency and imagination are required if we are going to be successful.\nAB InBev and representatives from the accelerator’s first cohort of 21 companies will talk about their innovations and how they’re helping the world at the upcoming Social Good Summit in New York City, Mashable's annual event in partnership with the UN Foundation that promotes the SDGs. \nFor 2019, AB InBev has set its sights on solving challenges like water scarcity, creating nutritious foods and beverages from its grain and yeast co-products, reducing the harmful use of alcohol, and making packaging more sustainable. Solutions will help the industry as a whole — and the world, as we come together for a more sustainable future."},"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F1049290%252Fd8968bfb-71a3-4ed1-8cfe-3e4cd678be08.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=6Mt2Z-Vd6MZotz8NBV9d-2L1Shg=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","feature_image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F103182%252Fae6202e4-790e-404c-b504-639463e0cdab.png%252F1438x0.png?signature=WJFaOwD52K81-BFl5yUmj3rRfPI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F103182%252Fae6202e4-790e-404c-b504-639463e0cdab.png%252F356x205.png?signature=UzINxI_CeWJu-fthqqXotzydzGs=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F103182%252Fae6202e4-790e-404c-b504-639463e0cdab.png%252F712x410.png?signature=fuShIQZ3dm1u2LTmjcsl6KN365s=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F103182%252Fae6202e4-790e-404c-b504-639463e0cdab.png%252F280x157.png?signature=Bx5Nhs5sKi_F6nOohApzZFB4M_M=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F103182%252Fae6202e4-790e-404c-b504-639463e0cdab.png%252F560x314.png?signature=oUZLcSJjLEwifuyXl1LC0JO02-Q=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"responsive_images_html5":{"img_set_info":{"tag_attributes":{"alt":"How the business world is leading the charge to save the planet","src":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F103182%252Fae6202e4-790e-404c-b504-639463e0cdab.png%252F356x205.png?signature=UzINxI_CeWJu-fthqqXotzydzGs=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com","src_type":"png","loading":"lazy","naturalWidth":"356","srcset":"https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F103182%252Fae6202e4-790e-404c-b504-639463e0cdab.png%252F280x157.png?signature=Bx5Nhs5sKi_F6nOohApzZFB4M_M=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 280w,https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fstory%252Fthumbnail%252F103182%252Fae6202e4-790e-404c-b504-639463e0cdab.png%252F356x205.png?signature=UzINxI_CeWJu-fthqqXotzydzGs=\u0026source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com 356w","sizes":"(max-width: 480px) 280w,356w"}},"image_caption_info":null,"image_credit_info":null,"data_clickthrough_info":null,"version_webp_callback":null},"display_title":"How the business world is leading the charge to save the planet","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"BdoM285E09","data-source":"blueprint"}],"gallery":[],"giftguide":{}},"excerpt":"Corporations look toward a sustainable future.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Social Good","channel_label":"Social Good","channel_link":"https://mashable.com/Social%20Good/","tweet_text":"How the business world is leading the charge to save the planet"},{"_id":"5d4023a02463a30773000002","id":"/article/wellset-los-angeles-wellness-startup/","title":"Wellness startup Wellset wants to avoid the 'woo woo' — and responsibility","title_tag":null,"author":"Rachel Kraus","post_date":"2019-07-30T11:00:00+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 11:00:00 +0000","formatted_date":"07/30/2019","sort_key":"1HSzD4","link":"https://mashable.com/article/wellset-los-angeles-wellness-startup/","content":{"plain":"A Los Angeles-based startup wants to be the Airbnb of the insta-buzziest concept of the 2010s: wellness. \nWellSet calls itself a discovery platform for \"wellness services\" like massages and acupuncture. On WellSet, users can find practitioners through a platform search or through recommendations from friends, brands, and public figures. Once users settle on a nutritionist or hypnotherapist, for example, they can book appointments within the platform itself.\nThe company, led by CEO Tegan Bukowski, is announcing Tuesday that it's raised pre-seed funding from a women-led team of investors. In the coming weeks, it plans to launch in Los Angeles featuring about 1,000 local practitioners on the platform, with a national expansion planned for later this year.\n\"We’re excited to create a true tech platform for wellness,\" Bukowski told Mashable. \"Everyone should have access to knowing what kinds of things they should eat, or mindfulness practices, or personal routines they can be taught to integrate into their daily life.\"\nWellness is a $4.2 trillion market that's been growing steadily year over year. Investors have put $2.5 billion into wellness startups, according to industry analyst Jeremiah Owyang, and he thinks that's just the beginning.\n\"This is a societal trend now, and the tech industry is coming around,\" he said. \"But we're really at the cusp of this market.\"\nWhen searching for any sort of alternative healer or coach — whether because traditional medicine hasn't worked out, or you're looking to make some basic lifestyle changes, or something else — it can be difficult to connect with the right field, let alone person. Sussing out the credentialed from the quacks, or whether an Ayurvedic practice will really help you more than a holistic health coach, can be daunting.\nCurrently, there are other platforms that help people find and book services with wellness practitioners, such as MindBody and ClassPass, but not one mainstream service dedicated to wellness as a whole. \nThat's where WellSet wants to come in. It hopes to bridge the communication gap between wellness seekers and legitimate, credentialed providers. That is a refreshing contribution to the sometimes-fluffy wellness industry. However, WellSet's stated reticence to provide more active guidance for users — especially when facilitating health treatments that may be scientifically murky — ignores some of the fundamental lessons the tech industry has learned about the dangers of the \"we're just a platform\" approach.\nSEE ALSO: Instagram's 'Hashtag Mindfulness' boom: The good, the bad, and the ugly\nWellSet will make money by charging practitioners a one-time 30 percent customer referral fee for each new customer who books through the platform, and a 3 percent transaction booking fee for repeat bookings. Investors are apparently into the idea; after raising startup money from the executives' personal networks, the recent pre-seed round included funding from Kelly Noonan Gores and Broadway Angels, who have invested in companies like Goldie Blox and Zume in the past. Bukowski also has a veteran wellness company executive, Executive Chairman Sky Meltzer, along with a former Pinterest growth strategist, COO Hanna Madrigan, at her side to scale and grow.  \nBased on the amount of cash and interest in the wellness space, WellSet could be poised to fill the need for a dedicated discovery platform. However, it will need to integrate the tech industry's hard-won lessons about user, worker, and medical accountability if it is to become a trusted, ethical companion, and not just the latest tech company to ride the pop-wellness gravy train.\n\nWellness is a slippery term, though some academics are actively working to define and scientifically prove its usefulness. WELL for Life -- a Stanford University program which promotes a \"proactive approach\" to physical and mental healthcare -- defines wellbeing as \"a holistic synthesis of a person’s biological, psychological, and spiritual experiences, resulting from interplay between individuals and their social, economic, and physical environments, that promote living a fulfilling life.\"\nBukowski, WellSet's CEO, doesn't like the term \"wellness\" because of its \"woo woo\" connotations. Instead, she prefers \"preventative healthcare,\" which is a term and approach places like Stanford WELL also use to describe a more proactive, lifestyle-based approach to healthcare.  \nTo maintain the integrity of \"wellness\" and avoid lumping practices like astrology alongside something like physical therapy, WellSet has instituted some thoughtful safeguards to define wellness services as distinct from more scientifically tenuous iterations of \"wellness.\"\nWellSet practitioners must be certified in their fields, and profiles feature reviews from their customers and students. WellSet has two tiers of practitioner verification, with the more stringent involving a manual check of credentials by the WellSet team. \nWellSet also only offers \"modalities\" (or practice areas) that are covered by insurance or flex spending dollars. Drawing the scientifically sound wellness line around the insurance industry's views of alternative medicine practices, Bukowski likes to describe the services on WellSet as \"medical adjacent.\"\n\"Making sure a practitioner could be covered by a flexible spending account (FSA) or insurance is one of the ways we choose the people that can be on the platform,\" Bukowski said. \"It’s different to appear away from the fringe, and to keep modalities really based in real results.\"\n\nStill, whether in travel, exercise, or food delivery, more than a few platforms have displayed the economic and societal pitfalls that come with building a platform that facilitates services from non-mainstream providers. In contrast to much-scrutinized companies such as Airbnb, which made changes to more stringently vet and curate hosts and properties, WellSet toes a mid-2010s tech industry line. It stresses that it is a \"discovery\" platform, and that it's up to users to \"go on their own wellness journeys.\"\n\"The important thing to know is that we aren’t a concierge,\" Bukowski said. \"We’re not telling anyone to go to a certain practitioner. This is a platform to connect practitioners with wellness seekers and potential clients. It’s a personal discovery process that we’re facilitating.\"\nThat stance doesn't sit well with Owyang. When connecting people with not entirely medically-vetted services, he thinks that the \"we're just a platform\" approach is irresponsible.\n\"Platforms cannot stand back and say they're transaction method only, they have to take responsibility for the transactions that happen there,\" Owyang said. \"Whether it's helping to vet or educate or inform it, they will be changing people's lives. And they will be held accountable if they're successful. So you can't stand back.\"\nSEE ALSO: Facebook limits the spread of quack cancer treatments but leaves wellness alone\nAdditionally, trends around natural medicine have been undermining some people's faith and trust in the medical industry. Cynically, this is something a business like WellSet could be tapping into — but that is not Bukowski's intention. Instead, the WellSet team hopes to promote wellness practices as a compliment to Western medicine.\n\"We really see part of what WellSet is doing as taking the idea of wellness and wellbeing and making it more mainstream,\" Bukowski said. \"Mental health and basic physical and preventative health should be a no-brainer for everyone.\"\nThat holistic approach to healthcare may be obvious to some. But what \"wellness\" actually means is highly personal, and not necessarily addressable through yoga or even a life coach. Suggesting that the road to well-being is paved with bookable services commodifies a meaningful, larger idea about what it means to live well.\n\"Well-being is greatly affected by the physical and social environments that we find ourselves in,\" Dr. Catherine Heaney of Stanford WELL for Life said. \"I am highly skeptical of treating well-being as solely an individual issue, without thinking about the role of these environments.\"\nWellSet's timing, consumer-friendly design, and tendency toward \"preventative medicine\" over spirituality-based practices have the potential to build a wellness services pipeline for a hungry consumer group and often hard-to-find practitioner base. However, if it is to go beyond just riding the wellness wave and truly promote well-being in a way that influences people's health for the better, it will have to take responsibility for educating and being accountable to a wellness-seeking public. \nAfter all, every \"journey\" requires a guide.\nUPDATE: July 30, 2019, 5:36 p.m. EDT \nWellSet told Mashable after publication that it plans to help educate its users with a blog, launching in September.

perform a colonoscopy before a crowd of hundreds in Los Angeles this June.\n\"This polyp is attached to a blood vessel, so if you try to remove it, it bleeds,\" he explained. Blood gushed while the crowd winced and moaned.\nNo, Glassenberg was not operating on a real patient. He was at the Social Innovation Summit in Los Angeles, showcasing a colonoscopy \"game\" that his company, Level Ex, has developed to help train doctors. \n\"We capture the challenges of the practice of medicine — diagnosis, clinical challenges, procedural challenges — and we capture them as video game mechanics,\" Glassenberg told Mashable.\nThe colonoscopy is just one of dozens of procedural options within Level Ex's four distinct game apps — Airway Ex, Gastro Ex, Pulm Ex, and Cardio Ex — which each contain simulations of real-life operations. Simply by downloading an app onto an Apple or Android smartphone or tablet, doctors and students can practice their craft, playing hyper-realistic surgical video games that simulate procedures like intubation, endoscopies, and, most recently, heart surgery, says Glassenberg. Doctors can even earn Continuing Medical Education (CME) credits, which ordinarily take the form of attending conferences, reading long manuals, or answering multiple-choice questions. \n\"I think gamification education is going to be the next frontier,\" Dr. Atman Shah, a University of Chicago interventional cardiology specialist and Level Ex physician adviser, said. \"If you can get to a point where it's actually realistic, the patient outcomes are realistic, the graphics are realistic, there's a real critical story, it becomes so much more meaningful for the person who's learning.\"\n\"I think gamification education is going to be the next frontier.\"\nDemand from doctors, and the company's growth, have been astronomical. After just four years of existence, 400,000 doctors and medical professionals are already practicing procedures on the apps, and, according to the company's data, one in three U.S. surgeons are using the apps. Level Ex also recently made some high-profile executive hires from the gaming industry, and debuted its fourth game, \"Cardio Ex,\" at the American College of Cardiology's annual meeting keynote in March. \n\"It's glorious,\" Glassenberg said of the games in the company's new Cardio Ex app. \"It really captures all the tough decision-making of interventional cardiology, starting with interesting, difficult cases, to fantastical cases. It's competitive, it's fun, and it really hones in on the reason why doctors go into medicine, which is the challenge.\"\nGlassenberg said Level Ex as an app-maker also receives regular support from Google and Apple, and has some partnerships with high-profile tech companies in the works (although he declined to specify further).\n\nCurrently, practicing medical procedures in real life has limitations: Physicians will attempt procedures and learn to use tools on already dead animals that don't bleed or react the way that a live human body would. Additionally, virtual physician training still involves traveling to \"simulation centers\" with bulky, arcade-esque games and graphics that are stuck in the '90s. Level Ex's value proposition is that it takes advantage of the tech everyone has — a smartphone or tablet — and then marries medical accuracy with the level of graphics you'd find in a video game today.\nLevel Ex has also developed AR and VR iterations of the games for even more realism in partnership with medical technology companies; one new game, in partnership with the American Heart Association, teaches people how to perform CPR in AR. That realism, whether in 2D, AR, or VR, is what Glassenberg says really attracts and differentiates the games — how true they are to life. \n\"The state of the art in medical training is decades behind the video game industry,\" Glassenberg said. \"There's physician training with multiple choice, and interactive textbooks. But nobody has anything with an interactive virtual patient that's squishy and bleeds.\"\n\nGlassenberg founded Level Ex by accident. From a family of physicians, he calls himself the \"black sheep\" for going into video game development; he worked at companies including Microsoft and Lucas Arts.\nIn 2012, his father, an anesthesiologist, asked him to do something \"actually useful,\" says Glassenberg self-deprecatingly. The senior Dr. Glassenberg requested his son make a video game that he could use to teach students how to perform a delicate airway procedure that involves sticking a scope down a user's throat. Glassenberg worked on the game for a few weekends, then put it in the App Store so that his dad could download it. He did not give any more thought to it. \nTwo years later, he checked on his game, titled iLarynx at the time, and realized it had been downloaded more than 100,000 times. He Googled iLarynx, and realized that medical schools had begun studying the game, and had even established that it helped them perform the procedure with more accuracy. \n\"At that point, I was like, OK, clearly there's demand here,\" Glassenberg said. \"What if we actually put a team of veteran game developers on this problem? What could we achieve?\"\n\nGlassenberg has since assembled a team of developers and executives, who have worked on video games ranging from Mortal Kombat to Diner Dash, along with an advisory board of 150 physicians. Developers will often visit hospitals and labs to learn about the technologies and methods for procedures. They'll even scrub up and observe surgeries in the operating room themselves. Then, physician advisers provide feedback on the game as it's in development, and play test versions.\n\"They would take that real-life knowledge and that experience and what they've seen, and then gamify it and then program,\" Dr. Shah, the cardiologist who advises Level Ex, said. \"Then along the way, I would review their cases.\"\nPhysicians also work with the developers to ensure that the games are meeting Continuing Medical Education (CME) educational objectives. Medical boards require that doctors fulfill a certain amount of continuing education credits. That usually takes the form of going to conferences across the country or answering multiple choice questions. Level Ex attracts doctors because fulfilling your CME credits with a competitive and challenging video game — at one's leisure — is a boon. \nHow can a game on a tablet possibly simulate a delicate, real-life surgery?\nShah also touted Level Ex games for their educational capabilities. He said that fellows and students who would normally not be allowed to operate on a real patient get a high-fidelity simulation that gives them a better idea of what they'd be facing in real life. It could also help doctors-in-training decide what areas of medicine they want to go into, or even help kids get interested in practicing medicine.\n\"It's 2019,\" Shah said. \"There are better, more exciting ways to augment and make better physicians.\"\n\nSo, how can a game on a tablet possibly simulate a delicate, real-life surgery?\nMany complex procedures these days don't actually require surgeons to plunge their hands into open human bodies. Instead, a lot of surgery involves the careful manipulation of wires and other high-precision tools, controlled with small hand movements and directed by watching a video feed from inside the patient's body on a screen. \nThe small finger motions of playing the game don't exactly translate to what a doctor would have to physically do in surgery, Shah said. But the scenarios doctors face, and the decisions they must make about what tools and methods to employ, are true to life. For example, making choices about what size \"balloon\" a doctor should employ to repair an artery is the sort of experience that one typically gains in surgical practice, not in textbooks.\n\"It's not the exact same as actually holding it in a patient,\" Shah said. \"But the game simulates how those different balloons and equipment will operate in the human heart.\"\nThe game is particularly useful for difficult cases, say Glassenberg and Shah. Physicians submit case studies from all over the world, and Level Ex can turn those real-life scenarios into games doctors can play and study. Eventually, Level Ex hopes to get to the point where doctors may be able to practice patient-specific procedures — using the real-world specs of the person they'll be operating on — as a high-fidelity game before operating in the first place.\nEarly research is promising about its ability to improve doctors' performance, but Shah said that more studies are still needed to conclusively evaluate whether playing a video game actually contributes to more successful surgeries, and more healthy patients. \n\"Does it actually reduce complication? Does it decrease hospital stays?\" Shah asked. \"We don't know. The healthcare system we have is all we all know. But it's really exciting to try to ask those questions.\"\nCorrection: July 2, 2019, 3:00 p.m. EDT \nThis story previously stated that Cardio Ex was developed in partnership with the American Heart Association (AHA). It was not; it was debuted at the American College of Cardiology conference. Level Ex developed a separate AR CPR training game with the AHA.
